# Everything you need to know about Few-Shot Learning

Few-Shot Learning (FSL) is a Machine Learning framework that enables a pre-trained model to generalize over new categories of data (that the pre-trained model has not seen during training) using only a few labeled samples per class. It falls under the paradigm of meta-learning (meta-learning means learning to learn).

This tutorial demonstrates two methods for implementing two shot learning in a Gradient notebook, and is a companion to the Blog titled by the same name (see link below)
